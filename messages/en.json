You could ask 10 friends to each give you $10, and in return, they each own a piece of your business. That's basically what a stock is!\n\n**A stock is a tiny piece of ownership in a company.** When you buy a share of Apple stock, you literally become a part-owner of Apple - the company that makes iPhones, MacBooks, and AirPods. Pretty cool, right?\n\nCompanies sell stock to raise money. Instead of borrowing from a bank, they sell little pieces of ownership to regular people like you and me. This money helps them build new products, hire employees, and grow their business.\n\n**Why would you want to own stock?**\n- **Growth**: If the company does well, your piece becomes more valuable\n- **Dividends**: Some companies share their profits with owners (that's you!)\n- **Voting rights**: As an owner, you can vote on big company decisions\n\n**Real Example:** If you bought 1 share of Apple in 2010 for about $10, it would be worth over $170 today! That's the power of owning great companies.",

            "content": "Think of a stock exchange like a giant marketplace - but instead of buying fruits and vegetables, people buy and sell pieces of companies. The two biggest exchanges in the US are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ.\n\n**The NYSE** is the oldest and most famous exchange. It's that building on Wall Street with the big American flag. Companies like Disney, Coca-Cola, and Walmart trade here.\n\n**NASDAQ** is a newer, electronic exchange. It's home to many tech companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.\n\n**How Trading Works:**\nWhen you want to buy a stock, your order goes to the exchange. The exchange matches buyers with sellers. If someone is willing to sell at the price you want to pay, the trade happens instantly!\n\n**Every stock has a ticker symbol** - a short code that identifies it:\n- Apple = AAPL\n- Disney = DIS\n- Tesla = TSLA\n- Nike = NKE\n\n**The market is open on weekdays** from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time. It's closed on weekends and holidays.\n\n**Fun Fact:** The NYSE started under a buttonwood tree in 1792, when 24 stockbrokers signed an agreement to trade with each other. Today, trillions of dollars trade hands every single day!",

If Apple shows $175.50, that's the price for one share.\n\n**Change:** Shows how much the price moved today. \"+$2.50\" means it went UP $2.50. \"-$3.00\" means it went DOWN $3.00. Green = up, Red = down.\n\n**Percentage Change:** Same thing but as a percent. \"+1.5%\" is easier to compare across different stocks than dollar amounts.\n\n**Open:** The price when the market opened this morning.\n\n**High/Low:** The highest and lowest prices reached today. This shows how much the price bounced around.\n\n**52-Week High/Low:** The highest and lowest prices in the past year. Useful to see if the stock is near its peak or bottom.\n\n**Volume:** How many shares traded today. High volume means lots of people are buying and selling. Low volume means less activity.\n\n**Market Cap:** The total value of the entire company. Calculated by: Stock Price × Total Shares. Apple's market cap is over $2 trillion - the most valuable company in the world!\n\n**Pro Tip:** Don't worry about memorizing everything. The most important numbers are the current price, the change (to see if it's up or down), and the trend over time.",

            "content": "The stock market has been around for over 200 years, and it's had some wild rides! Learning about past crashes helps you stay calm when markets get scary.\n\n**The Great Depression (1929)**\nThe market crashed 89% over three years. People lost everything. Banks failed. It took 25 years for stocks to recover. This led to new rules to protect investors.\n\n**Black Monday (1987)**\nThe market dropped 22% in ONE DAY - the biggest single-day drop ever. But here's the key: it recovered within two years. People who panicked and sold lost money. Those who held on were fine.\n\n**Dot-Com Crash (2000)**\nEveryone went crazy for internet companies. Pets.com, Webvan, and hundreds of others promised to change the world. Most went bankrupt. The lesson? Just because something is exciting doesn't mean it's a good investment.\n\n**2008 Financial Crisis**\nBanks made risky bets on housing. When housing prices fell, banks collapsed. The market dropped 50%. But if you invested $10,000 at the BOTTOM of the crash, it would be worth over $50,000 today.\n\n**COVID Crash (2020)**\nThe market dropped 34% in just one month! But then it recovered faster than any crash in history - hitting new highs within months.\n\n**The Big Lesson:** Every crash looks like the end of the world when it's happening. But the market has ALWAYS recovered and gone higher. The secret is: don't panic, don't sell, and think long-term.",

            "content": "When a company first sells its stock to the public, it's called an IPO - Initial Public Offering. It's like a company's debut on the stock market stage!\n\n**Why Do Companies Go Public?**\n- **Raise Money:** They can raise billions to grow faster. When Facebook went public, they raised $16 billion!\n- **Cash Out Early Investors:** Founders and employees who got stock can finally sell it\n- **Gain Credibility:** Being publicly traded makes companies seem more trustworthy\n- **Attract Talent:** They can offer stock to employees as part of their pay\n\n**How an IPO Works:**\n1. The company hires investment banks (like Goldman Sachs) to help\n2. They decide how many shares to sell and at what price\n3. Big investors get to buy first (not fair, but that's how it works)\n4. On IPO day, regular people can finally buy shares\n\n**Famous IPOs:**\n- **Google (2004):** Started at $85, now worth over $140 (after splits)\n- **Facebook (2012):** Started at $38, now worth over $300\n- **Amazon (1997):** Started at $18, now worth over $150 (after splits)\n\n**Warning About IPO Hype:**\nNot every IPO is a winner. Many IPOs drop after the first day. WeWork tried to go public at $47 billion but nearly went bankrupt. Be careful about buying stocks just because they're new and exciting!\n\n**Pro Tip:** It's often better to wait a few months after an IPO before buying. Let the hype settle down and see how the company actually performs.",

Here's everything you need to know to get started!\n\n**What is a Brokerage Account?**\nA brokerage is a company that lets you buy and sell stocks, ETFs, and other investments. Popular options include Fidelity, Charles Schwab, Robinhood, and Vanguard.\n\n**Types of Accounts:**\n- **Individual Brokerage Account**: The most common type. You can deposit and withdraw anytime, but you pay taxes on your gains each year.\n- **Roth IRA**: Special retirement account. You pay taxes now, but your money grows tax-free forever! Great for young investors.\n- **Traditional IRA**: Pay taxes later when you retire. Good if you think you'll be in a lower tax bracket then.\n- **Custodial Account (UTMA/UGMA)**: For kids under 18. A parent manages it until you're an adult.\n\n**What You Need to Open an Account:**\n- Social Security Number\n- Date of birth\n- Home address\n- Employment information\n- Bank account for transfers\n\n**Choosing the Right Broker:**\nLook for: commission-free trading, no account minimums, good mobile app, educational resources, and strong customer service. Fidelity and Schwab are great for beginners!\n\n**Pro Tip:** Start with one account to keep things simple. You can always open more later as your investing grows.",

            "content": "Good news: investing has never been cheaper! But there are still some costs to watch out for. Let's break them all down.\n\n**Commission-Free Trading:**\nMost major brokers no longer charge fees to buy or sell stocks and ETFs. This is huge - it used to cost $7-10 per trade! Now you can invest small amounts without fees eating your returns.\n\n**Expense Ratios (for ETFs and Mutual Funds):**\nWhen you buy a fund (a basket of stocks), there's a small annual fee. This is expressed as a percentage:\n- 0.03% = Excellent (pay $0.30 per $1,000 invested)\n- 0.20% = Good (pay $2 per $1,000)\n- 1.00% = Expensive (pay $10 per $1,000)\n\n**Fees to Watch Out For:**\n- **Account maintenance fees**: Some brokers charge if your balance is too low\n- **Inactivity fees**: Charges if you don't trade for a while\n- **Transfer fees**: Costs to move your account to another broker ($50-100)\n- **Paper statement fees**: Extra charges for physical mail\n- **Foreign transaction fees**: Extra costs for international stocks\n\n**The Hidden Cost - Bid/Ask Spread:**\nWhen you buy a stock, you pay slightly more than if you sold it at the same moment. This difference is called the \"spread.\" For popular stocks like Apple, it's just pennies. For tiny stocks, it can be much more.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Stick with low-cost index funds (0.03-0.10% expense ratio) and avoid any account with maintenance fees. Every dollar in fees is a dollar that's not growing for you!",

Most common method.\n- **Wire Transfer**: Faster (same day) but costs $15-30. Only use for large amounts.\n- **Check Deposit**: Mail a check or use mobile deposit. Takes a few days.\n\n**How Much Do You Need to Start?**\nGood news: most brokers have $0 minimums! You can literally start with $1. But here's what's realistic:\n- **$1-50**: Great for learning with fractional shares\n- **$100-500**: Good starting point to build a small portfolio\n- **$1,000+**: Gives you more options and diversification\n\n**Fractional Shares - The Game Changer:**\nCan't afford a $500 share of Tesla? No problem! Most brokers now let you buy \"fractional shares\" - a piece of a share. With $10, you could own 0.02 shares of Tesla or Amazon. This makes it easy for anyone to invest in expensive stocks.\n\n**Setting Up Automatic Investments:**\nThe secret to building wealth? Invest regularly without thinking about it. Set up automatic transfers from your bank:\n- Weekly: $25/week = $1,300/year\n- Bi-weekly: $50/paycheck = $1,300/year\n- Monthly: $100/month = $1,200/year\n\n**Pro Tip:** Start small but start NOW.

Super diversified and low cost.\n- **Blue Chip Stock**: A big, stable company like Apple, Disney, or Coca-Cola.\n\n**Step 2: Research Before You Buy**\nAsk yourself:\n- Do I understand what this company does?\n- Is this company growing or shrinking?\n- Am I okay holding this for 5+ years?\n\n**Step 3: Choose Your Order Type**\n- **Market Order**: Buy right now at whatever the current price is. Simple and fast.\n- **Limit Order**: Set the maximum price you'll pay. More control, but might not execute.\n\nFor beginners, market orders are fine for large, popular stocks.\n\n**Step 4: Decide How Much**\nYou can usually enter:\n- Number of shares (e.g., \"10 shares\")\n- Dollar amount (e.g., \"$100 worth\")\n\n**Step 5: Review and Submit**\nDouble-check everything:\n- Right stock? (Check the ticker symbol!)\n- Right amount?\n- Right order type?\n\nThen hit \"Submit\" or \"Place Order.\" Congratulations - you're now an investor!\n\n**What Happens Next:**\nFor market orders, your trade usually fills in seconds. You'll see the shares in your account almost immediately. You'll also get a confirmation with all the details.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Don't stress about timing the market perfectly.

Understanding risk is the first step to managing it - and protecting your money!\n\n**What is Investment Risk?**\nRisk is the chance that you might lose money, or that your investment won't grow as much as you hoped. The key rule: higher potential reward usually means higher risk.\n\n**Types of Risk:**\n- **Market Risk**: The whole market goes down (like in a crash). Even good companies fall.\n- **Company Risk**: One specific company has problems. Think Enron or Blockbuster.\n- **Inflation Risk**: Your money grows slower than prices rise. $100 today buys less in 10 years.\n- **Liquidity Risk**: You can't sell when you need to. Some investments are hard to cash out.\n\n**Risk vs. Reward:**\nImagine a scale:\n- **Low Risk, Low Reward**: Savings accounts (1-2% growth, but very safe)\n- **Medium Risk, Medium Reward**: Bonds and balanced funds (3-6% growth)\n- **Higher Risk, Higher Reward**: Stocks (7-10% average, but wild swings)\n- **Highest Risk**: Individual stocks, crypto, options (could double... or lose everything)\n\n**Your Risk Tolerance:**\nHow would you feel if your investment dropped 20% tomorrow?\n- \"I'd panic and sell\" → You need lower-risk investments\n- \"I'd be nervous but hold\" → Moderate risk is okay\n- \"I'd buy more at the discount\" → You can handle higher risk\n\n**Pro Tip:** Only invest money you won't need for 5+ years.

Diversification is your superpower for reducing risk without giving up growth.\n\n**What is Diversification?**\nDiversification means spreading your money across different investments. If one goes down, others might go up - balancing things out.\n\n**Why It Works:**\nImagine you own just one stock - a pizza company. If pizza becomes unpopular, you lose big. But if you also own a salad company, a gym, and a streaming service, the gym and salad gains might offset your pizza losses!\n\n**Ways to Diversify:**\n1. **Across Companies**: Own many stocks, not just one\n2. **Across Industries**: Mix tech, healthcare, retail, finance, etc.\n3. **Across Size**: Big companies (Apple) + small companies (growth potential)\n4. **Across Countries**: US stocks + international stocks\n5. **Across Asset Types**: Stocks + bonds + real estate\n\n**The Easy Way: Index Funds**\nOne index fund like VTI owns over 4,000 US companies! Instant diversification in one purchase. S&P 500 funds (like VOO) own the 500 biggest US companies.\n\n**How Much Diversification is Enough?**\n- 1 stock = Very risky\n- 10-15 stocks = Good start\n- 30+ stocks = Well diversified\n- Index fund = Ultimate diversification\n\n**Warning: Over-Diversification**\nOwning 100 individual stocks is actually worse than one index fund. It's more work, more fees, and you're basically recreating the index anyway!\n\n**Pro Tip:** For most beginners, one total market index fund (like VTI) gives you all the diversification you need.

Understanding volatility helps you stay calm when markets get crazy.\n\n**What is Volatility?**\nVolatility measures how much a stock's price swings up and down. High volatility = big swings. Low volatility = steady and calm.\n\n**Examples:**\n- **Low Volatility**: Coca-Cola might move 1-2% on a typical day\n- **Medium Volatility**: Apple might move 2-4% on a typical day\n- **High Volatility**: Tesla might move 5-10% on a typical day\n- **Extreme Volatility**: Meme stocks can move 50%+ in a day!\n\n**Volatility is Not the Same as Risk:**\nA stock can be volatile (bouncy) but still be a good long-term investment. Tesla has been super volatile, but long-term holders have done great. Volatility is only a problem if you panic and sell at the wrong time.\n\n**Why Stocks Are Volatile:**\n- Earnings reports (good or bad news)\n- Economic data (jobs, inflation, interest rates)\n- World events (wars, pandemics, elections)\n- Investor emotions (fear and greed)\n\n**Volatility and Time:**\nShort-term: Stocks can swing wildly\nLong-term: Returns smooth out\n\nThe S&P 500 has had years of -37% AND years of +38%. But over 20+ years, it's averaged about 10% annually.\n\n**How to Handle Volatility:**\n1. Don't check your portfolio every day\n2. Remember: volatility is normal\n3. Focus on years, not days\n4.

Position sizing helps you avoid betting too big on one thing.\n\n**What is Position Sizing?**\nPosition sizing is deciding what percentage of your total portfolio goes into each investment. It's about not putting too much in one basket.\n\n**The Basic Rules:**\n- **Never put more than 10% in a single stock**: If it crashes, you only lose 10%\n- **5% is even safer**: Gives you room for 20 different investments\n- **Index funds can be bigger**: Since they're already diversified, 25-50% is fine\n\n**Example Portfolio ($1,000):**\n- 40% in Total Market Index Fund (VTI) = $400\n- 20% in International Fund = $200\n- 10% in Apple = $100\n- 10% in Microsoft = $100\n- 10% in Amazon = $100\n- 10% in Cash (for opportunities) = $100\n\n**Position Sizing Based on Confidence:**\n- Very confident: Up to 10% in one stock\n- Somewhat confident: 3-5%\n- Speculative bet: 1-2% max\n- Super risky (meme stocks, crypto): Only money you can lose completely\n\n**The Concentration Trap:**\nMany people's biggest mistake is putting too much in one stock because \"it's definitely going up.\" Even the best investors are wrong often. By limiting position sizes, you protect yourself from being wrong.\n\n**Special Case - Your Employer's Stock:**\nDon't put more than 10% in your employer's stock. If the company struggles, you could lose your job AND your savings. Enron employees learned this the hard way.\n\n**Pro Tip:** As you add more money to your portfolio, make sure new purchases balance out your positions.

If you have no emergency fund, you might have to sell your stocks - possibly at a loss - to pay for it.\n\nWorse: What if the market is down 20% when you need to sell? You'd lock in losses and miss the recovery.\n\n**How Much Do You Need?**\n- **Minimum**: $500-1,000 for small emergencies\n- **Good goal**: 1-2 months of expenses\n- **Ideal**: 3-6 months of expenses (for adults with bills)\n\n**Where to Keep Your Emergency Fund:**\n- High-yield savings account (earning 4-5% in 2024)\n- Money market account\n- NOT in stocks, bonds, or anything that can lose value\n\n**The Right Order:**\n1. First: Build a starter emergency fund ($500-1,000)\n2. Then: Start investing, even small amounts\n3. Over time: Grow emergency fund to 3+ months\n4. Always: Keep emergency fund separate from investments\n\n**Golden Rule:**\nOnly invest money you won't need for at least 5 years. Bills, rent, emergency money?

Impersonator Accounts**\nFake accounts pretending to be Warren Buffett, Elon Musk, or other famous investors, offering \"investment opportunities\" or crypto giveaways.\n\n**5. \"I'll invest for you\" Schemes**\nSomeone offers to manage your money and promises huge returns. They either steal it directly or lose it trading.\n\n**Red Flags:**\n- Lifestyle photos (cars, jets, watches) instead of actual education\n- \"DM me to learn more\" (real educators teach publicly)\n- Promises of specific returns (\"make 10% per week\")\n- Pressure to join exclusive groups or pay for access\n- No mention of risks or losses\n\n**Pro Tip:** Real successful investors rarely need to brag on social media.

For example, if you work at Apple and know they're about to announce a great new product, buying stock before the announcement is illegal.\n\n**Why is it Illegal?**\nThe stock market only works if everyone has access to the same information. If insiders could trade on secrets, regular investors would always lose. It's cheating.\n\n**Who Counts as an \"Insider\"?**\n- Company employees and executives\n- Board members\n- Family and friends of the above\n- Anyone who receives confidential information\n- Even YOU if someone tells you secret info\n\n**Real Examples of People Who Got Caught:**\n- Martha Stewart went to prison for 5 months for insider trading\n- A congressman was convicted for trading on COVID info\n- Tech executives regularly get caught and fined millions\n\n**How the SEC Catches People:**\n- They use algorithms to spot suspicious trading patterns\n- They track trades before big announcements\n- They investigate connections between traders and company insiders\n- Tip lines where people report suspicious activity\n\n**What About \"Legal\" Insider Info?**\nCompany executives CAN trade their own company's stock, but:\n- They must report all trades publicly (Form 4)\n- They must follow trading windows\n- They can't trade before major announcements\n\n**Pro Tip:** If someone offers you a \"hot tip\" about non-public information, walk away.

If It Sounds Too Good To Be True, It Is**\nNo legitimate investment guarantees returns. Anyone promising \"risk-free\" gains is lying.\n\n**2. Never Invest in Something You Don't Understand**\nScammers rely on confusion. If you can't explain what a company does in simple terms, don't invest.\n\n**3. Verify Everything**\n- Check if the company is real (SEC EDGAR database)\n- Look up the person giving advice (are they registered?)\n- Read real news sources, not promotional material\n\n**4. Protect Your Account**\n- Use strong, unique passwords for brokerage accounts\n- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)\n- Never share login info with anyone\n- Beware of phishing emails pretending to be your broker\n\n**5. Don't Share Personal Financial Info**\nLegitimate advisors don't ask for your passwords or account access via DM.\n\n**Where to Report Scams:**\n- SEC: sec.gov/tcr (Securities violations)\n- FINRA: finra.org/investors/have-problem (Broker complaints)\n- FTC: reportfraud.ftc.gov (General fraud)\n- Your state's Attorney General\n\n**Before Any Investment, Ask:**\n1.

When the Fed changes this rate, it affects everything: mortgages, car loans, credit cards, and yes - stocks.\n\n**How Interest Rates Affect Stocks:**\n\n**When Rates Go DOWN:**\n- Borrowing is cheaper → companies can grow faster\n- Savings accounts pay less → investors look for better returns in stocks\n- Home buying increases → economy strengthens\n- Stock prices usually RISE\n\n**When Rates Go UP:**\n- Borrowing is expensive → companies slow down\n- Savings accounts pay more → some money leaves stocks\n- Mortgages get pricier → housing slows\n- Stock prices often FALL (at least short-term)\n\n**Why Does the Fed Change Rates?**\n- To fight inflation (raise rates to slow spending)\n- To boost the economy (lower rates to encourage borrowing)\n\n**Fed Meetings:**\nThe Fed meets 8 times a year.

Buy a stock at $50, sell at $75 = $25 capital gain.\n\n**When Do You Owe Taxes?**\nYou only pay taxes when you SELL. If your stocks go up but you don't sell, you don't owe any taxes yet. This is called an \"unrealized gain.\" Smart investors use this to delay taxes for years or even decades.\n\n**Capital Gains vs. Regular Income:**\nCapital gains from investments are taxed differently (often lower) than regular income from a job. This is one reason investing is so powerful for building wealth.\n\n**Capital Losses - The Silver Lining:**\nIf you sell at a loss, you can use that loss to offset gains:\n- $1,000 gain + $500 loss = only $500 taxable\n- If losses exceed gains, you can deduct up to $3,000 from regular income\n- Extra losses carry forward to future years\n\n**Dividends Are Taxed Too:**\nDividends you receive are also taxed. \"Qualified dividends\" (from most US companies held 60+ days) get the lower capital gains rate. Regular dividends are taxed like income.\n\n**Important Terms:**\n- **Cost Basis**: What you paid for the investment (including fees)\n- **Proceeds**: What you sold it for\n- **Capital Gain/Loss**: Proceeds minus cost basis\n\n**Pro Tip:** The easiest tax strategy?

Married couples can give $36,000/year to each recipient.\n\n**Basic Estate Planning Tips:**\n- Keep good records of what you paid for investments\n- Consider holding highly appreciated assets until death\n- For large estates, trusts can help manage tax efficiently\n- Talk to a professional for complex situations\n\n**Note for Young Investors:**\nThis might seem far off, but understanding it helps you:\n- Know why your parents/grandparents might hold old investments\n- Make better long-term planning decisions\n- Start building wealth that could benefit future generations\n\n**Pro Tip:** If you inherit investments, check the cost basis before selling. Many people accidentally pay taxes they don't owe because they don't know about step-up basis.",

These are better for people with complex financial situations or large portfolios.\n\n**Discount Brokers** (like Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Robinhood) charge little to no fees and let you make your own decisions. These are perfect for beginners and most individual investors.\n\nWhen choosing a platform, look for:\n- Commission-free stock trading\n- Easy-to-use mobile app and website\n- Educational resources for beginners\n- Good customer service\n- Account minimums (many have $0 minimums)\n- Research tools and stock screeners",

            "content": "Before you invest, you need to understand what you're looking at. Stock charts are your window into how a stock has performed and where it might be going.\n\n**Why Charts Matter:**\nCharts show you a stock's price history at a glance. Instead of reading thousands of numbers, you can see patterns, trends, and key moments visually.\n\n**Types of Charts:**\n\n**1. Line Charts**\nThe simplest type - just a line connecting closing prices over time. Great for seeing the overall trend.\n\n**2. Bar Charts**\nShow four prices for each period: open, high, low, close (OHLC). More information than line charts.\n\n**3. Candlestick Charts**\nThe most popular type for traders. Each \"candle\" shows the same four prices as bar charts, but in a visual format that's easier to read.\n\n**Time Frames:**\nYou can view charts over different periods:\n- 1 day (minute-by-minute)\n- 1 week, 1 month (daily)\n- 1 year, 5 years (daily or weekly)\n- All time (weekly or monthly)\n\nShort-term traders focus on short time frames. Long-term investors look at months and years.\n\n**What to Look For:**\n- **Trend**: Is the stock going up, down, or sideways?\n- **Volatility**: How much does it bounce around?\n- **Key Levels**: Are there prices where it tends to stop or reverse?\n\n**Pro Tip:** As a beginner, focus on longer time frames (1 year or more).

While patterns don't predict the future perfectly, they can give you clues about what might happen next.\n\n**Important Note First:**\nNo pattern works 100% of the time. These are hints, not guarantees. Always combine pattern recognition with other research!\n\n**Bullish Patterns (May Suggest Prices Going UP):**\n\n**Hammer**\nSmall body at top, long lower wick. After a downtrend, it suggests buyers are stepping in. \"The price tried to fall, but buyers pushed it back up.\"\n\n**Bullish Engulfing**\nA small red candle followed by a larger green candle that completely covers it. Shows buyers overwhelming sellers.\n\n**Morning Star**\nThree candles: big red, small body (any color), big green. Suggests a bottom and potential reversal upward.\n\n**Bearish Patterns (May Suggest Prices Going DOWN):**\n\n**Shooting Star**\nSmall body at bottom, long upper wick. After an uptrend, suggests sellers are pushing back. \"Price tried to rise, but sellers pushed it back down.\"\n\n**Bearish Engulfing**\nSmall green candle followed by larger red candle that engulfs it. Shows sellers overwhelming buyers.\n\n**Evening Star**\nThree candles: big green, small body, big red. Suggests a top and potential reversal downward.\n\n**Neutral Pattern:**\n\n**Doji**\nOpen and close are almost the same (tiny or no body).

            "content": "Now that you can read individual candles, let's look at the bigger picture: trends and key price levels.\n\n**What is a Trend?**\n- **Uptrend**: Higher highs and higher lows - the stock is climbing\n- **Downtrend**: Lower highs and lower lows - the stock is falling\n- **Sideways/Range**: Price bounces between two levels - no clear direction\n\n**Support Levels:**\nSupport is a price floor where buyers tend to step in. When a stock falls to this level, it often bounces back up. Think of it as the price where people say \"That's cheap enough, I'll buy.\"\n\n**Resistance Levels:**\nResistance is a price ceiling where sellers tend to appear. When a stock rises to this level, it often gets pushed back down. Think of it as the price where people say \"That's expensive enough, I'll sell.\"\n\n**How to Spot Them:**\nLook for prices where the stock has bounced multiple times. If it touched $50 and bounced up three times, $50 is support. If it hit $75 and fell back three times, $75 is resistance.\n\n**Breakouts:**\nWhen a stock pushes through resistance or falls through support with strong volume, it's called a breakout. This often leads to a bigger move in that direction.\n\n**Why This Matters for Investors:**\nEven long-term investors can use these concepts:\n- Buying near support = potentially better entry price\n- Buying during a clear uptrend = momentum on your side\n- Understanding resistance = realistic expectations for gains\n\n**Pro Tip:** Don't obsess over finding perfect support and resistance.

          "explanation": "Payment for order flow (PFOF) is when brokers like Robinhood sell your trade orders to market makers. This is how they make money from 'free' trading, but it can result in you getting slightly worse prices on your trades."
