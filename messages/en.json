When you want to buy a share of Apple or Tesla, you need a brokerage account to do it.\n\nThere are two main types of brokerages:\n\n**Full-Service Brokers** charge higher fees but provide personal financial advisors who help you make decisions. These are better for people with complex financial situations or large portfolios.\n\n**Discount Brokers** (like Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Robinhood) charge little to no fees and let you make your own decisions. These are perfect for beginners and most individual investors.\n\nWhen choosing a platform, look for:\n- Commission-free stock trading\n- Easy-to-use mobile app and website\n- Educational resources for beginners\n- Good customer service\n- Account minimums (many have $0 minimums)\n- Research tools and stock screeners",

Visit Fidelity.com and click 'Open an Account'\n2. Choose account type (Individual Brokerage for most people)\n3. Provide personal information and verify identity\n4. Link your bank account for transfers\n5. Fund your account\n\n**Navigating the Interface:**\n- Dashboard shows your portfolio overview\n- 'Trade' button to buy/sell stocks\n- 'Research' for stock analysis and news\n- 'News & Research' for market updates\n\n**Mobile vs Desktop:**\n- Mobile app is great for quick trades and monitoring\n- Desktop/web offers more advanced research tools\n- Both sync automatically - use whatever is convenient",

This means you can buy $100 of Apple stock without paying $5-10 extra in fees.\n\n**Account Fees to Watch:**\n- Maintenance fees: Some brokers charge if your balance is low\n- Inactivity fees: Charges if you don't trade for a period\n- Transfer fees: Costs to move your account to another broker\n- Paper statement fees: Extra charges for physical mail\n\n**Hidden Costs (Payment for Order Flow):**\nSome 'free' brokers like Robinhood make money by selling your orders to market makers. This can result in slightly worse prices on your trades. Fidelity and Schwab don't do this for stocks.\n\n**Comparing Platforms:**\n| Platform | Stock Commissions | Account Minimum | PFOF |\n|----------|------------------|-----------------|------|\n| Fidelity | $0 | $0 | No |\n| Schwab | $0 | $0 | No |\n| Robinhood | $0 | $0 | Yes |\n| TD Ameritrade | $0 | $0 | Yes |",

Search for the stock by name or ticker symbol\n2. Click 'Trade' or 'Buy'\n3. Choose order type (Market or Limit)\n4. Enter number of shares or dollar amount\n5. Review all details carefully\n6.

This matters for active trading but less for long-term investors. Most brokerages provide real-time data free to account holders.\n\n**Trading Halts and Circuit Breakers:**\nTrading can be paused when:\n- A stock moves too fast (company-specific halt)\n- The entire market drops significantly (circuit breaker)\n- Level 1: 7% drop = 15-minute pause\n- Level 2: 13% drop = 15-minute pause\n- Level 3: 20% drop = market closes for the day\n\n**Stop Orders:**\n- **Stop Order**: Becomes a market order when price reaches your stop price\n- **Stop-Limit Order**: Becomes a limit order at your specified price\n- Used to limit losses or protect profits automatically",
